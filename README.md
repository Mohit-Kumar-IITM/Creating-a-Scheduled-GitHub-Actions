# 🧪 TDS GitHub Actions Automation Task

This repository contains my solution to the GitHub Actions automation task for the **Tools in Data Science (TDS)** course.

---

## 📌 Task Description

Create a scheduled GitHub Action that:

- ⏰ **Runs daily** using cron syntax (specific hours/minutes — no wildcards)
- 📧 **Includes a step** labeled with your email: `23f2005559@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
- ✅ **Creates a commit** in each run
- 📁 Is located in the `.github/workflows/` directory

---

## ✅ Post-Setup Requirements

After setting up the workflow:

1. 🚀 **Trigger** the workflow manually and wait for it to complete
2. 🧾 Ensure it appears as the **most recent action** in the repository
3. 🕒 Verify it **creates a commit during or within 5 minutes** of the workflow run
